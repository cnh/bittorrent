"""
The TorrentMgr manages downloading and uploading for a torrent specified by a
metafile.  The TorrentMgr gets the metafile information and initializes itself
to reflect whether pieces of the torrent are already on disk (not implemented).
Then it communicates with the tracker to get the addresses of peers.

The TorrentMgr determines the strategy of whom to contact for which pieces
including end game strategy.  It manages the amount of download and upload
traffic is also a function of the TorrentMgr (not implemented).

This implementation of the TorrentMgr is simple in many ways.  Initially, it
opens a fixed number of connections with peers.  Upon receipt of a bitfield
or have message which includes a needed piece, it expresses interest to that
peer.  When that peer unchokes, it starts sequentially requesting blocks for
that piece.  If the peer chokes in the middle of the piece, the data received
so far is put aside and the rest of the piece assigned to the next free,
unchoked peer which has the piece.  When a connected peer has multiple needed
pieces, the rarest piece across all peers is chosen to acquire.  When a peer
delivers a complete piece and has no other needed pieces, the TorrentMgr tells
it that it is no longer interested.  Then it opens a connection to an
additional peer.  Generally, the number of peers for whom the TorrentMgr is
interested stays at the fixed number although it will temporarily exceed that
number when a peer for whom there was no interest notifies the TorrentMgr
that it has obtained a needed piece.

Periodically, the TorrentMgr checks to over the peers that are interested and
requesting to try to rectify potential hung situations such as when a peer is
interested but unchoked for a long period of time or when it has an outstanding
request over a long period of time.

This TorrentMgr does not currently implement pipelined requests, an endgame
strategy or uploading.
